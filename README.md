ChrizHUD
========

My custom HUD. I will try to update it more frequently than I have been in the past. Add me if you have any questions or tweaks that you want to make to the HUD. The HUD in its current form is what I like to use and it will obviously not be for everyone!

Everything you need to know
----------------------

In order to install the HUD navigate to C:/program files x86/steam/steamapps/common/team fortress 2/tf/custom. Once you are here you can drag the folder named "HUD" straight in.

THAT'S IT!

Hope you enjoy!

I have also included a net_graph tweak because I was too lazy to remove it. It compacts the graph so it's better anyway.

I have also included the old files in case you prefer the old versions.

If you prefer the old circle crosshair find CrossHairCircle located in hudlayout.res and change "visible" from 0 to 1.

I have also modified my crosshair (again) because I do that frequently. If you would like the old crosshair (the one used prior to 8/3/2013) delete "hudlayout.res." Then change "hudlayoutOldXhair.res" to "hudlayout.res."

In order to disable the crosshair that you see me use you must delete the hudlayout.res file located inside the scripts folder. Then, change the file name of "hudlayoutNOXhair.res" to "hudlayout.res"
